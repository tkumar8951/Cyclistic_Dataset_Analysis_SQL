ðŸš¨ The Challenge:  How can a Chicago-based bike-share company convert more casual riders into annual members?

Case Study Description:
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, you will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations:

Monthly or weekly packages can be introduced in the off seasons.
For trials, free day passes can be given or awareness campaigns can be used to encourage people about health benefits of cycling.
Targeted digital campaigns can be used on weekends
Time-based discounts can be offered during weekday hours to shift patterns.
Marketing should be done in beginning of summer season i.e. May, June so that riders are aware if it and month of Sept, Oct to retain members in winter season.
